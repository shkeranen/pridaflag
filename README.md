# pridaflag
A Quick Python Program which Draws a Pride Flag

Couple notes:
- The naming conventions are largely in Finnish at this one.
- The original code is partly from here: https://pythoncircle.com/post/661/python-script-11-drawing-flag-of-united-states-of-america-using-python-turtle/
- This article gave me an idea to try pride flag and the code is modified accordingly.

Fun, quick project to do!
